# üçΩÔ∏è Rasavilaas ML

**Rasavilaas ML** is a modern machine learning project designed to deliver intelligent ingredient-based food recommendations. Leveraging the richness of Indian cuisine, the system combines NLP techniques with similarity-based learning to create a contextual and scalable recommendation engine. The project integrates a FastAPI backend and Jupyter-based exploratory workflows, making it suitable for both experimentation and deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

- Ingredient-aware food recommendation engine
- Interactive Jupyter notebook for NLP and model training (`rasavilaas_ml.ipynb`)
- Production-ready FastAPI backend (`app.py`) to serve predictions
- Reproducible virtual environment setup (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Clean project structure with modular codebase

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bandishachowdhury07/Rasavilas-ML
cd Rasavilas-ML
```

### 2. Set Up the Python Virtual Environment

> Choose the commands based on your operating system.

#### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

To **deactivate**:
```bash
deactivate
```

To **delete** the environment:
- **macOS/Linux:** `rmdir /s /q venv`
- **Windows:** `rm -rf venv`

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all necessary packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook

The core data science workflow is in:

- `rasavilaas_ml.ipynb`

To configure the Jupyter kernel:
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=rasavilas_ml_env --display-name="Python (rasavilas_ml_env 3.12.10)"
jupyter notebook
```

Then select the custom kernel for execution.

---

### 5. Run the FastAPI Backend

Deploy the recommendation engine with FastAPI and Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict](http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict)

---

### 6. Make Predictions via API

Send a `POST` request to `/predict` with your ingredients:

**Example 1:**
```json
{
  "ingredients": "rice, egg"
}
```

**Example 2:**
```json
{
  "ingredients": "rice, egg",
  "N": 5,
  "mean": false
}
```

Test with:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"ingredients": "rice, egg"}'
```

## ‚ú® How It Works: Recommendation Logic Summary

> For a deeper technical overview, see `rasavilaas_ml.ipynb`.

### üåé 1. Data Ingestion
- Load pre-cleaned Indian recipe dataset with ingredients and metadata.

### üìà 2. NLP Preprocessing
- Tokenize, lowercase, and clean ingredients for vectorization.

### üìä 3. Feature Extraction
- Use **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** to numerically represent ingredient text.

### üîó 4. Similarity Matching
- Compute **cosine similarity** between vectorized ingredient sets.

### üîç 5. Prediction Engine
- Return top-N similar dishes based on input ingredients.

---

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

- **Environment not activating:** Confirm OS-specific syntax.
- **Install errors:** Run `pip install --upgrade pip` and try again.
